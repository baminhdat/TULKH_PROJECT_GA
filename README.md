# Overview
Result of the major assignment of the Planning Optimization course, School of Information and Communication Technology, Hanoi University of Science and Technology.
An implementation of the Genetic Algorithm to solve the Multiple Bin Packing Problem, that is, the Multiple Knapsack Problem plus a lower bound constraint for every knapsack.
# How to run
Currently, the algorithm is compiled and run directly via the IntelliJ IDE.
# Results
For all given instances, the algorithm is capable of finding a better solution than their given counterparts. However, this result requires the algorithm to be repeated several time for each instance because of the randomness in its operation.
Currently i am working on a method to reduce the effect of this randomness.
# Contact and Improvement
If you have any idea regards the improvement of the algorithm, feel free to contact me at bminhdat03.p@gmail.com
